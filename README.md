## 👋 Hey, I’m Carl

I’m a Computer Science student at Indiana University Bloomington (Luddy School of Computing), graduating in May 2027.  
I’m focused on building solid web and backend systems, with growing experience in accessibility, scalable design, and mentoring others in core CS concepts.

Outside of coursework, I’m involved in student org leadership, volunteer work, and continuously sharpening my technical skills through hands-on projects.
